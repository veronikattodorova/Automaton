# Automaton project

This is an university assignment, the goal of which was to create an application that can mimic the functionality of a deterministic finite automaton.

Learn more about the structure of a deterministic finite automaton: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton

## Classes and structure

Brief descriptions of the structure and some of the functionality of each class/file can be found inside the `documentation` folder.

Alternatively, clicking on any of the links below will take you to the documentation of the specified class.

- ### [DFA](documentation/DFA.md) - The main representation of a determenistic finite automaton

- ### [Menu](documentation/Menu.md) - Provides the options that the end-user sees in the console and calls the methods of `DFA`

- ### [State](documentation/State.md) - State class, used by the DFA class for its state representation

- ### [MyStr](documentation/MyStr.md) - Utility class, designed to mimic the function of a string

- ### [Exceptions](documentation/Exceptions.md) - File, containing custom exceptions that are thrown by different `DFA` and `Menu` methods
